Our team Avalanche build this project from the motivation of our company and Rameel Rahman through the hackathon. The main motivation is the interest behind finding out solutions(designs) for new new problems.
In Current days MX Format is not available MT format is prevailing. So there is a need of translator which converts MT103 Message in the text format to MX message in the xml format.
By the end of 2024 all the messages of transactions will be formated in the form of MX xml.
The main advantages ISO 20022 is richer, better defined and more granular than its predecessor SWIFT MT, and it improves the quality and consistency of data across messages and financial processes as well as the automation of its processing.
In the context of Payments Clearing and Settlement, there is one schema for Customer Credit Transfers (pacs.008), one for the Financial Institution Credit Transfers (pacs.009), or one for the Payment Returns (pacs.004) among others. This results in a proliferation of schemas being generated so the selection of the appropriate schemas for a particular project is important.

For solving this problem we go through different packages and modules. The modules we used are bs4,xml,tkinter.

### **Steps for opening and running the project**

1. Download the github repo to your desktop
2. Import xml,bs4 and other modules to ur system if it is not present.
3. Run the output.py file in the system.
4. In the graphical interface click the open button 
5. upload the mt message from the directory
6. Output will be visible in the terminal

### **Steps for solving the problems**

1. Problem identification
2. Design the algorithm for solving the problem
3. Coded the program in python
4. Test the code
5. Rectified the errors
6. Run the code
